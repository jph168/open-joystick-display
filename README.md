# Open Joystick Display
**A powerful and easy to use streamer-ready overlay for your joystick or gamepad. Completely free and open source.**

### Project Upgrade
Project Set on Continuing and Enhancing Open Joy Stick Display.
As of writing the application works just fine from my testing except for one documented bug regarding the N64 RetroSpy configuration.
